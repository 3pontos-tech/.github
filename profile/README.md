# 3Pontos - Tech

Welcome to the official tech branch of **3 Pontos**, a financial accelerator transforming lives through smart investments, practical technology, and social impact.

We are the builders behind the ecosystem — where education, financial organization, and investment meet code.

## 🚀 Our Stack

We build modern web products using the best tools from the PHP and frontend world:

- 🧱 **Laravel** – Robust backend foundation
- 🧩 **FilamentPHP** – Admin panels and internal tools
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first styling for speed and flexibility
- ⚡ **Livewire** – Reactive components, without leaving PHP
- 🐳 **Docker** – Portable, reproducible development environments
- 🧼 **Laravel Pint** – Code style enforcement (PSR-12 + opinionated)
- 🔁 **Rector** – Automated code upgrades and refactors
- 🧪 **PestPHP** – Elegant and minimal testing framework
- ⚙️ **Laravel Forge** – Provision and deploy unlimited PHP applications in seconds.

> Everything we build is tested, containerized, optimized and documented for maintainability and clarity.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Every feature we ship connects to one of our core pillars:  
> **Education. Organization. Investment.**

We believe that technology should:
- **Empower people**, not overwhelm them
- **Scale with clarity**, not chaos
- **Stay modular**, composable, and adaptable
- **Be documented**, tested, and easy to onboard

Our development team culture is based on daily basis communication featuring practices. 

- ✅ Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- ✅ Run Pint and Rector before pushing
- ✅ Use Docker for consistent environments
